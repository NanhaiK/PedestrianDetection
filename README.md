# PedestrianDetection
This repository is the VS2015 version of my another project Pedestrian Detection.  
I merge some common feature of my research in this.  
I am glad if this solution can help somebody who researches same topic.  
The old one will save but not maintan. 
If you like the old one, you will like this one too.

The remaining of my student career is about half year.  
I'll put all of my research result here during the time.

You can use the modules of this repository every where if you need.  
The comments of all will slowly compelete.
Wellcome to report any problem or advisis.
